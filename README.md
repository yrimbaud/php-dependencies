# Download Dependencies PHP Script

## Presentation

This script is designed to download a specified package using Composer, create a ZIP file containing the package and its dependencies, and then delete the `vendor` directory. It's written in PHP and uses Composer for package management.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the script using the command `php downloadDependencies.php`.

Please ensure that you have PHP and Composer installed on your machine before running the script.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the script, please check the following:

- Ensure that PHP and Composer are correctly installed and added to your system's PATH.
- Check the package name specified in the script. It should be a valid package that can be found on Packagist.
- If the `vendor` directory is not being deleted, ensure that the script has the necessary permissions to delete files and directories.
